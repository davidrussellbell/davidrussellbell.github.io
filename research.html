									<h2>Machine Learning, Chemistry, Physics, and Biology</h2>
										<p>Machine Learning (ML) and Artifical Intelligence (AI) techniques are powerful tools to explore and interrogate unsolved problems in Chemistry, Physics, and Biology. They are not magical, perfect solvers for every problem (unfortunately!): they have their limitations and weaknesses. However, in my experience, when used appropriately, these techniques can add value to research projects. I am interested in ML techniques for exploring natural and synthetic molecules. This includes modeling structure, dynamics, interactions, and function. In my research statement, I propose several projects that incorporate ML, including GANs for multiscale modeling (in itself an explainable AI techinque in my opinion), Gaussian Processes for interpolating interactions, and time series models for dynamic prediction. I retain diverse interests in the burgeoning ML field, particularly moving beyond supervised learning problems and using ML in a generative capacity.</p>

									<h2>Multiscale Modeling</h2>
										<p>Multiscale molecular modeling is a technique that approximates molecular systems at different scales of interest, from quantum and atomic representations to coarse-grained particles. The often-cited advantage of multiscale modeling is the ability to capture relevant time and length-scales of interest in the coarse-grained representation that are too expensive to computationally model in the high-dimensional atomic representation. However, by building a coarse-grained model, we are simplifying the system to a few select sites, and by doing so, we get a better appreciation of the important features of the system. In other words, by simplifying the system, we see what is really driving the behavior. I would argue that multiscale modeling is a form of explainable AI, where you simplify the system to a low-dimensional latent space, conduct modeling, and the map back the the high-dimensional state. I cite below an example from my PhD work where I incorporated thermodynamic information into a multiscale RNA structure prediction model. I also cite a work where I used multiscale modeling to study crowded membrane protein diffusion. I have further used multiscale models to study DNA mechanics as well as intrinsically disordered protein structure. As I highlight in my research statement, I am very interested in using ML techniques to increase the accuracy of multiscale models.</p>

									<h2>Antigen Immunotherapies</h2>
										<p>Immune complexes, in particular, I find to be vastly complex, as typified by catch bonds and selection against minimum energy configurations. I have studied at length the immune complex of MHC-II-TCR, which is responsible for activation of immune T-cells for a variety of different effects, including autoimmune disease. This interaction is mediated by a small peptide, which strongly binds the MHC, but binds the TCR through much weaker interactions. As cited below, I have predicted MHC binding affinity of a small peptide implicated in Type-1 Diabetes using MD simulations and the Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) technique. During this project, I generated a large dataset of MD simulations and FEP data that I have subsequently explored using classification techniques and an autoencoder-ML pipeline (waiting in line for publication). Predicting peptide-MHC binding affinity is difficult due to strong attractive dispersion forces present in the binding site. I have used ML techniques to reduce the computational cost of this prediction as well as generate predictions of novel small peptides that could be used as immunotherapy vaccines.</p>

										<p>Synthetic nanomaterials, from a classical perspective, tend to exhibit less dynamic behavior than biological systems, yet hold more direct application. As I cite below, I have studied CdSe quantum dot aggregation and interaction with a widespread protein domain to understand quantum dot toxicity. I found interesting concentration-dependent quantum dot binding behavior that blocked the protein active site at high concentrations, indicating a potential mechanism of toxicity. My previous group at IBM performed a lot of work in nanomaterial modeling, discovering how graphene punctures bacterial cell walls and how gadolinium metallofullerenols suppress pancreatic cancer. These are fascinating problems, with important applications that I am very interested in.</p>

                                                                        <h2>Nucleic Acids and Interactions</h2>
										<p>Nucleic acid structure, dynamics, and interactions also prove a formidable challenge to model, primarily because nucleic acids are highly charged polymers. I have built a multiscale model to predict nucleic acid structure using statistical potentials and experimental free energy information. In a more recent work, a collaborator challenged us to design a higher affinity RNA aptamer starting from sequence. We predicted nucleic acid aptamer structure using bioinformatics constraints and focused on Mg2+ ion binding, which screens the charged backbone of the nucleic acid. Under this approach, I built a 3-D RNA structure that I used to predict RNA-protein binding, as predicted through various methods, including Docking, Molecular Dynamics simulations, Steered MD, and Free Energy Perturbation calculations. The exciting part of this work was that our designed RNA sequence was verified by our collaboratores using calorimetry experiments.</p>
